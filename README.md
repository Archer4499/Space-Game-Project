# Space Game Project

A (VS2013) project to make a game similar to FTL and Starseed by 2 people using few external or std libraries.

List of 3rd party libraries:
- https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt
- https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h
- https://github.com/syoyo/tinyobjloader
- And the following not included libraries:
  - http://www.glfw.org/download.html 32-bit Windows pre-compiled binaries.
  - http://glad.dav1d.de with the following settings:
    - language: C++
    - gl: version 3.3
    - profile: Core
    - generate a loader selected.

Parts with reasonable progress so far include math and logging.
