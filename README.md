# Space Game Project

A project to make a game similar to FTL and Starseed by 2 people, written mostly from scratch using few external or std libraries.

It has been set up as a Visual Studio 2013 project.

A list of the 3rd party libraries that we are using:
- https://github.com/fmtlib/fmt
- https://github.com/nothings/stb/blob/master/stb_image.h
- http://www.glfw.org/download.html (32-bit Windows pre-compiled binaries)
- http://glad.dav1d.de with the following settings:
  - language: C++
  - gl: version 3.3
  - profile: Core
  - "Generate a loader" selected.

Parts that are resonably feature complete include the math and logging libraries.
